In this course, we are going to learn how to build a full-stack NFT minter application on Shardeum liberty testnet. We will start with an empty hardhat project, write all the nedeed smart contracts and create a basic front-end to interact with the deployed smart contracts.

The features we will be building out:
- Connect Wallet Button to connect with the Shardeum Network.
- Input form for user to enter NFT name and details.
- Media uploader which directly uploads it to IFPS using Pinata.
- Transaction History for last mints.
- User friendly UI elements to keep the user involved about each step of the transaction.
