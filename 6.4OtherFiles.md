## Final Tweaks

So far, we have already built out the most important fucntionalities, in thsi step we are just going to add some minor changes & tweak some files to make our app work!

First, let's start with styling.

Create a ***Theme.js*** file and add the following theme styling:

```
import { createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: "dark",
    
    primary: {
      main: "#ffc926",
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#088ef3",
    },
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: "Roboto, Arial, sans-serif",
    h4: {
      fontWeight: 700,
      marginBottom: "16px",
    },
    h5: {
      fontWeight: 600,
      marginBottom: "12px",
    },
    h6: {
      fontWeight: 500,
      marginBottom: "8px",
    },
    subtitle1: {
      fontWeight: 400,
      marginBottom: "8px",
    },
    caption: {
      fontStyle: "italic",
    },
  },
});
export default theme;
```

Also, make the necessary changes in App.js, App.css, index.js & index.css to incorporate all the styling and import the necessary files. 

You can find the final files for these in the [Github Jist](https://shardeum.org/blog/build-an-nft-minter-dapp-on-shardeum/) here.

If you are stuck at any point/receive errors which you are not able to solve, please comapre your code with the code of the fully built out application.
